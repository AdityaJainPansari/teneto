      "# Example 1: Network Representations\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Conceptual introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example we will review the two different network representations which are used in Teneto. These are *graphlets* and *contact* representations. In this noteboot, it is shown how Teneto can translate between these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temporal networks have connections (edges) between nodes through time. In a \"static\" (non-temporal) network connections between a group of nodes can be represented in a 2-dimensional array where each dimension contains the number of nodes (i.e. the array contains: node x node).\n",
      "\n",
      "With time, the simplest way to represent this numerically is a 3-dimesnional array (node x node x time). This means that every index in the temporal dimension gives a traditional static connectivity matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a network is sparse (i.e. many connections are 0) it may not be efficient to have . Thus another way to represent the 3D network is to list the connections. Instead of every possible connection existing, we instead create a 2-dimensional arraw where each row is a new edge and the columns represent a (node x node x time) index.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two main types of network representations are *graphlets* (3D array) and *contact* representations (time stamps of edges).\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphlets are a 3D array form of the network in a numpy array. Contact are python dictionaries that contain the temporal stamps of edges (and more information).\n",
      "More of a general introduction to temporal networks and some of the measures in temporal network theory can be found here: http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/24/096461\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Different software tools for network theory (e.g. pajek, networkx) represent their networks in certain ways. We currently do not have conversion tools between their ways of representing networks. However, compatibilitiy with other software representations will be developed sometime in 2017."
